== Writing in AsciiDoc

You can write an AsciiDoc document using any text editor.
We recommend selecting an editor that supports syntax highlighting for AsciiDoc.
The color brings contrast to the text, making it easier to read.
The highlighting also confirms when you have entered the correct syntax for an inline or block element.

For more syntax examples see link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference].

IMPORTANT: Save the file with a file extension of `.adoc`.
----
. From the directory that contains your AsciiDoc document, run the following command.
+
[source]
----
asciidoctor sample.adoc
----
+
. List files in the current directory.
. Open the `sample.html` in your web browser.
